    Welcome to my archive of webpages, a dedicated space for preserving source
    material against the risk of online disappearance. Each page within the
    archive includes a link back to the original source.
    <strong>It is <em>highly</em> encouraged that you use the original links</strong>
    whenever possible, ensuring the original content creators receive their due 
    recognition and traffic, provided the original material remains accessible online. 
    Even better, if you can, please install the

    My motivation for capturing these snapshots is rooted in a simple yet
    powerful need: to keep the ever-changing web content available for my notes.
    It's easy for online articles, essays, and stories to disappear without a
    trace, taking with them knowledge and perspectives that deserve to be
    preserved. This project is implemented with the help of

    The source for this website is forked from the 
    <a
      href="https://github.com/vertis/permanent-web-snapshots"
      class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700"
      >original project</a>

      >GitHub</a>.
    It's worth noting that you shouldn't fork the original project, but rather copy and create an
    unconnected repository if you want to reuse this. This is because of the large size
    of the SingleFile HTML files that causes Git to take a while to clone the repository.
